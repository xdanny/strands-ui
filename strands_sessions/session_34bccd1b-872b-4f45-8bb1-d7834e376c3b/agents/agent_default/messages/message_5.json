        "text": "Yes—Apache Spark is a fast, general‑purpose cluster computing system.  \nKey points:\n\n| Feature | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **In‑memory processing** | Keeps data in RAM (or off‑heap) for speed; can spill to disk if needed. |\n| **Unified engine** | Handles batch jobs (`Spark SQL`, `DataFrames`), streaming (`Structured Streaming`), machine learning (`MLlib`) and graph processing (`GraphX`). |\n| **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)** | Low‑level, immutable distributed collections with fault tolerance via lineage. |\n| **Lazy evaluation** | Builds a DAG of transformations; execution starts only on an action. |\n| **Cluster managers** | Works with YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes or its own standalone cluster manager. |\n| **Language APIs** | Java, Scala (native), Python (`pyspark`), R (`sparklyr`). |\n\nTypical use cases: ETL pipelines, real‑time analytics, ML model training at scale, and interactive data exploration. If you need help writing Spark code, optimizing jobs, or understanding concepts, just let me know!"
